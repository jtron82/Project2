                <li>
                  Explain the need to evaluate system usability.

                  Create a Basecamp post for the group describing your work. Title the post with the same group name and project 3. Your post should include the names of your group members and the following&#x3a;
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Testing script with a welcome to your participant, an explanation of the process, and an outline of the exact tasks you will be asking participants to complete.
                    </li>
                    <li>Testing notes + 3 major issues per participant.</li>
                    <li>
                      A group-authored recommendation report on the three most pressing issues identified through your testing, including:
                      <ul>
                        <li>an explanation as to why the issues you’ve selected are most pressing.</li>
                        <li>possible approach to implementing fixes/improvements to address the issue.</li>
                        <li>future usability tests you’d run to ensure the quality of the fix.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Test your site with three different participants <b>not</b> in our class. At least one participant should use a mobile device (phone or tablet); at least one should use a traditional device (desktop or laptop)
                </li>
                <li>
                  When possible, have participants use their own devices (but have a backup device ready to use)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Figure out how to best involve online students in your group who cannot be present on campus for testing; include those details in your site plan
