# Project2

# I've learned a lot throughout this project on how to redesign a website by changing color schemes for a better appeal or changing up how the text is being seen. I've definitely learned html, css, and js a little more in depth as I should change these as needed for a mobile platform. As for my progress in the class, I feel like it was a very smooth and steady pace to learn and keep up. The material was very straightforward and interesting to learn as everything taught in class will be applied to our future careers.
