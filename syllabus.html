            <p>
              This course favors a mobile-first approach to web design and development, with special attention to the 
              challenges of designing touch-screen interfaces. Students will learn development methods based on prototyping 
              and rapid iteration, supported by version control and low-stakes user-testing. The design principles the 
              course will emphasize include color, material design, rich web typography, and responsive grid-based page 
              layout. Accessibility, progressive enhancement, and thoughtful, thoroughly researched use of edge technologies 
              and polyfills will be treated as guiding techniques throughout the course. Student work is organized around 
              projects of varying size and scale, emphasizing the course's hands-on, theory-grounded approach to web design 
              and development.

              Students in this course will learn the importance of 
              human-computer interaction design and the effectiveness of user-centered design. The 
              course will cover a survey of methods frequently used by the HCI profession, such as 
              usability testing and prototyping, as well as general design principles and how to use 
              design guidelines. A particular emphasis will be placed on usability for Web site 
              engineering, and students will apply knowledge from the field in the design and 
              construction of user-centered Web sites.
